If you have a laptop to bring or can borrow one, that is reason enough. 
Haskell has a reputation for being really hard, 
but that is after n number of years of other programming approaches that almost require unlearning. 
Haskell may not be the easiest of programming languages to learn. 
But what made it a must do for me was:  
its elegance,
its consistency 
its concision, 
its speed, 
its robustness. 
I for one would find Java harder to go back to, or C++. 
Yet others find Haskell more of a challenge. 
It is really is all a matter of context. 
9th and 10th grade math is about all that you need to start. 
There is much to learn but exposure to Algebra 
will help make Haskell more familiar.
It also comes down to how much you want to do it, 
and the ability to avoid self recrimination for not getting it quick enough. Having fallen prey to that kind of ideation myself (though not with Haskell), will sap the will to continue, more than the difficulty of the material.
So if you want to try, 
I am glad to have you.
