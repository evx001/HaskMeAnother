participants are more confident in recognizing fuller sentenses 

"ants in the kitchen ate the sweet Jelly which was on the table." (this was the sentense that they thought they had seen even though they had only seen fragments of the sentense interspersed.  


Full pattern recognition of prototypes were assembled from mere fargments. 


Economy of organization 
	participants take longer to respond to statements across category levels 
		going up the tree 

Exempler 

	when we categ we compare new instances against familiars rather than against a prototype. 

Categ for prediction 
	Decision Boundary (Ashby & Gott, 1988) 

Subjects bisect plane diagonally before they attempt to creat quadrents

Similarity Measures 
Romesburg 1984 
Shape diff 
vs 
Size displacement 

Euclidian distance 
Cosine similarity 
Correlation coefficient 

Sim measures 
	Co-occurrence count 
		subj rents both movies 
	Correlatioon 
		a function of the diff in reatings when a person rented both movies 
	
Correlated weighted by probability (signif) 
Mean Euclidian distance of movie x user interactions 
	interaction = R - (M.avg + U.dev) 

Weighted by similarity in 
	movie release times, rent freg, mean rating 

User Clusters 
	Diff movie means rating and simularity 
	R.pred = Mcluster_avg + U.cluster_dev 
	+ w.avg(interaction  * sim_cluster(M,M.p)) 

By experinec (num of movies rated) 

by gender 
	infered form pref for diff movie clusters 

by cluster analysis 
	PCA, Kmeans

Blend it 
Gen diff sets of predict using diff movie similarity and user cluster strategies 

Use linear regress to combine the sets of predictions into one final prediction 

weak learner are good too as long as they provide unigue info 


a single prediction set doesn't give much but combining it with others creates
