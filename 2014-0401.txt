Once a titanic sized organization charts a direction nothing short of an Iceberg dead ahead will alter it's course. It's the age old Turing vs Lambda calculus paradox. If you start in Turing, Lambda Calc is a remote abstraction. Start in Lambda Calculus and Turing seems like a long way down into bare metal. This tension has been with us since the 1960's. Sadly most languages in common usage don't look much beyond 1970 for their ideas and when they do they only cherry pick a couple and throw them into their shopping cart and head to the checkout. So C and it's children dominate our discourse; it's just how it is.
