Getting Into Haskell: 

	I see two routes into Haskell each representing the seeker's starting point. 
	Two reasons for a Haskell exploration. 
		pain
		curiosity
		or both

	It's just Scheme + Type-Classes and Monads 

	Materials: 
		Learn You A Haskell for Greater Good (sophmoric in style [complete with fat jokes in the examples])
			examples are in ACII and can be typed directly into the repl

		Graham Hutton "Programming Haskell" 2006, under 200 pages. 
			Eric Miejer Functional Programng with Haskell (which uses Hutton's) book other examples are in C#
			Math Symbols can be obscure to the uninitiated.
			uses the hugs compiler which has been depricated.  
						
		Phil Waldler 2012 @ Endenburrough University 
			20+ videos. 
			Videos are an hour but 1/4 to a 1/3 of the time is eaten up by class logistics 
		
		Beginning Haskell (a project book, not really for beginners) 
			2014 


		Functional Programming with Haskell 
			3rd edition 2011
			2nd is from 1999 

	Really helpful things to know but arn't obvious.  
		left justify all bindings in a single column. 
		All tabs should converted to spaces. 
		Monomorphic restriction confusion
		what's on the right of the = must always stay on the right of the =.
		What's on the left of the = must always stay on the left of the =. 
		Type system can feel excessively restrictive until ....
