	overhead increase by carrier api 
	6 api average apps 
	watch for increasing backend network traffic 
	3rd party api can choke an otherwise performitive app. 
	power consumption is always going to be important even against responsiveness  
	Appurify for app testing 
	Crashes or Hangs are number one complaint 
		then performance responsiveness 
		then content / feature issues

		OS memory requirements in 6 to 7 was severe 
		it is more expensive to get new users than to keep existing users 
		Know your user base and prioritize so that bug fixes get prioritized to hit the most users 
	testing frameworks 
		small QA

			use random app crawlers 
				
			but if you must test then appurify
