    trees 
        the world out side is a mess 
    
    Thoughts about trees 
        pointers go down 
            parents to children 
        pointers up 
            database 
        linked list 
        Diamond 
            acyclic 
            conical 
            a graph
        
        cycle isn't a tree because we don't
        
        pointer cycles are the tail of all evil as well as the root

        B[D] -> B[E] 
        
        cycle's have to be copied in their entirety 
        generally trees don't
            unless there are dopey up-pointers
        add in a level of indirection 
        
        "Context is King" 
        
        symbols: the Original Identities 
        Context     
        Not just for identities 
            
        Context in action. 
            where are you missing it? 
        
`       use extensible maps
            like a Json obj sort of 
            not a straight up list ['a'['b'[c]'d']'e']
                cause you will have to revisit it to add in identifiers 
            context in your stack 
                reify that state 
            State is mostly an illusion when we are in clojure. 
               zipper function 
          
        strict eval is procedural ultimately 
            Lazy is only somewhat less procedural
