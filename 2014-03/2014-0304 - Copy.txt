 0303-0304 Monday into Tuesday 
All day on Lubuntu config of HaskSnapUntu7.6.3 
though the ubuntu derived ghc 7.4 and it's associated platform 
might have worked okay for most things, in order to do 
Snap or Yessod or ... 
the most recent versions of GHC and Platform where required. 

worst was the the config 
having to use ghc 7.4 to load 7.6
then getting the path right. 
$HOME was what was screwing me up 
I wish the shell had given a warning that the path was wrong 
after $HOME was deleted from bashrc 
I could get the it to see it. 

Made a copy of freshly configured 
cause if the image breaks I want a 
fall back point
