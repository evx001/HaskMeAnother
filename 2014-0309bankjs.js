 
e-commerce just works, we are living this miricle. 
	cuase we now don't have to visit a bank in person to do our banking. 

Browsers are quietly 
	giving us all the error notifications we could possible want; 
	it just doesn't let them get in the way.  

MIME type of the file is text/html and the browser executes the file as JavaScript. 
	This is good because the browser, dispatches a warning as a log entry. 

No problem just execute the file and find out more abour it.
